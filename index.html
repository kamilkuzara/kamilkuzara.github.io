            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a Computer Science graduate from King's College London with a Master's degree. With three years of hands-on experience in Java and two years in Python,
              I've developed a strong foundation in software development.<br><br>

              My passion lies in tackling optimisation problems and delving into their applications and solution algorithms. Over the recent years,
              I've dedicated significant time to studying various optimisation techniques and their real-world implementations. My expertise extends to
              parallel algorithm design and multi-threaded programming, where I've successfully applied these skills to enhance computational efficiency in previous projects.<br><br>

              Combining my academic background with practical experience, I bring a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical concepts and their practical applications
              in software development. I'm eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.<br><br>

              Outside of the tech world, I'm an avid Formula 1 enthusiast, drawn to the rivalry and the intricacies of engineering and strategy that drive the sport.
              In my leisure time, you'll often find me on the basketball court or with a good physics book learning about the mysteries of the Universe.

                <h2>Parallelising JavaFF</h2>
                <p>
                  I completed the project during my penultimate year at university. As it was a substantial individual project, it was the equivalent of a Bachelor's Thesis.
                  The topic of the project was "Introducing parallelism to the JavaFF planner" and the goal was to analyse the sequential algorithms used by JavaFF - a Java-based
                  implementation of a popular planner FF - and propose parallel alternatives. <br><br>

                  The project involved a significant amount of research across the field of automated planning. Looking into the relevant literature, I investigated possible
                  solutions to the problem and gained an in-depth insight into the area of classical planning as well as a broad overview of the entire field. Despite the wealth
                  of existing research in the area of parallel planning, I did not find a solution that would be feasible to implement into the JavaFF planner without the need to
                  redesign the entire system. Therefore, I proposed 3 solutions of my own. They parallelised various aspects of the search. <br><br>

                  I am especially proud of the Parallel Enforced Hill-Climbing Search algorithm of my invention as it successfully sped up the search. In fact, on some test problems,
                  my algorithm turned out to be almost 50% faster than the standard, sequential version. Developing the algorithm required the use of various concurrent programming
                  techniques such as barriers, mutexes, and a sophisticated deadlock prevention system. The other solution of my design that performed well was a parallelisation of the
                  computation of heuristics. Albeit simple conceptually, it required me to redesign the sequential search algorithm to accommodate the use of a thread pool. The added
                  effort proved to be worth it as the solution was also successful in speeding up the search. <br><br>

                  Working on this project allowed me to learn advanced concepts in concurrent programming and parallel algorithm design. I also got to dive deep into the field of automated
                  planning and AI and was able to appreciate the complexity of this research area.

                <h2>Pintro</h2>
                <p>
                  Pintro is a mobile networking app. Similarly to LinkedIn, its fundamental objectives are to enable connections in a professional and business setting. The project was developed
                  by a team of seven as part of a university coursework. We were tasked with developing the app for an external client. The functionality of the app includes features such as user
                  and business profiles, and a fully fledged real-time chat.<br><br>

                  The system we developed is based on a client-server architecture. The client app (or the front-end, if you will) was developed in React Native and the server (back-end) was based
                  on Node.js, Express.js framework and MongoDB. This fit in the "JavaScript everywhere" philosophy. The testing of the system was performed with Postman and Jest, and we used Docker
                  for deployment. The choice of all these technologies was guided by their flexibility and allowed for rapid development. In fact, it enabled us to complete the project in time and
                  to client's high expectations. Moreover, of all other teams' projects, it was ours that was chosen for deployment by the client.<br><br>

                  Most of my work was at the back-end. I was involved in the modelling of the database. Then, I developed REST API endpoints which enabled interaction with the model. It was important
                  that the system supported secure connections and log-in functionality. Therefore, I took up the task of implementing some fundamental security measures. Specifically, I implemented
                  the HTTPS server ensuring security of data in transit, as well as strong password hashing using the PBKDF2 function with salt. I also worked at the front-end developing app components
                  such as the chat.
